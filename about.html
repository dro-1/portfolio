                I always knew I wanted to be in tech since I was a child, hence Tech
                World, Here I Am.

            I am a front end developer with a knack for building fully responsive
            websites. I've gotten my hands into Unity3D and BackEnd Development but I
            still have a long way to go especially in Design.
